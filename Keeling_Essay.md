1. __Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?__

	For most of my life I thought that computer programming was out of my reach. With such a wide array of interests in the physical sciences and humanities, I never put much thought into whether I could be interested in computer sciences. In July of 2015, a friend of mine sat with me at a bar and began explaining what he does at his consulting job as a project architect. He decided that the best way to explain Python was to open his computer and have me try my hand at it.

	I learned how much I enjoyed the logic and problem solving behind computer programming and he decided I had an aptitude for the work. Since then, we have met once every two weeks to discuss projects he wants me to try and aid me with more difficult learning blocks I encounter. So far, he has had me create a simple dice game and an RPG-like game, go through Euler’s problems online, and complete the Django tutorial. Currently I am turning the RPG into an interactive web application with a focus on using SQL databases for my instances of classes.


2. __What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?__

	Within the next two years, I hope to be in a position where I am able to conduct data analyses. While earning my environmental studies degree, I was able to work with geographic information systems (GIS) software and I hope to find a position that brings me back to that sort of work. The environmental community in general has a dearth of computer science specialists. During my internship I realized that even my menial computer skills were highly valued. I hope to bring programming to the environmental work I have always been passionate about.

	Five years down the road I hope to still be challenged by my work. As the technological and social spheres evolve, I want to be constantly evolving with them; five years from now my career should still be a place where I am still working on intriguing problems where I don’t have the answer before I start. I will constantly be improving how I navigate complex problems and design projects and learning new subjects outside my skillset.


3. __Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?__

	The most recent mistake that ended up teaching me a good deal of information I otherwise would have not accessed was a simple syntax error in my writing of the Django tutorial website. It was a simple punctuation malapropism, but this mistake brought up an error indicating the SQLite3 database was not extant.

	Because I had transferred my project to a new computer, my fear was that SQLite3 did not get installed with my Django program. The only SQLite3 instance on my computer was a file that the computer did not know how to read. I did not yet know that SQLite3 was a binary file, so I assumed there was an application missing.

	Eventually I realized my simple mistake, but before then I downloaded SQLite3, learned about how to use my computer’s administrative command prompt, learned more about the nature of SQLite3, and learned how to access the database contents via the command prompt and SQL commands. Most importantly to me, I realized I was able to utilize the documentation which had previously been so overwhelming to me, which has since given me a new source for how I learn and use code.


4. __Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.__

	When I picked up Samoan fire knives, I knew no one who had even heard of them. So I turned to performances of fire knife champions from Hawaii and Samoa available on the internet. I drew from these performances basic information on how the knives are traditionally wielded. I took note of specific trends in use and tried to begin choreographing around them.

	I ordered a book on the history of the fire knife so that I could learn of the culture I was going to be drawing from whenever I performed with the knives. When I learned it was originally used as part of training for warriors, I contacted a friend who knew knife and sword forms to transfer the forms to my knives.

	I was going to be using the fire knives in an unlit context as an accent in a high school colorguard performance. To keep coherency, I practiced rifle and saber moves on the fire knives. I worked for weeks every day after school to choreograph and improve my skills. By the time of our final performance, I was proficient with the knives and even taught some simple skills to the other girls.
